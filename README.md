## How to install?
Copy paste to your UnrealEngine folder, the path should match and you should normally end up replacing existing files. That's it !

## What changed?
* Only Images: Tabs and Windows buttons ( close, minimize, etc.. ), and few other small things.
* No code was touched during creation of this lazy work.

## Can I have a screenshot that compares with the original theme?
Of course!
