## How to install?
Copy paste to your UnrealEngine folder, the path should match and you should normally end up replacing existing files. That's it !

## What changed?
Background Images: Tabs and Windows buttons ( close, minimize, etc.. ), and few other small things.
Code: Nothing.

## Which version did you use?
Unreal Engine 4.15.2 compiled from source. 
_( I think this works with binary builds as well, but I haven't tested )_

## Can I have a screenshot that compares with the original theme?
Of course!
